## Background

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since they began in the late aughts. Everyone from indie creators to famous celebrities have utilized crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.
  
Getting funded on a crowdfunding website requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's assignment, I organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 generated sample projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

I converted the data provided for me into comprehensible charts and graphs so that I may come to some conclusions of the state of crowdfunding platforms.
 
The Word document attached has a report of what conclusions were made from the crowdfunding campaign data, what limitations to the data were and what other charts/grpahs/tables could be made with the provided data.
